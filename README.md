# Train Seating Simulation
Summary: I do fun stuff with netlogo

## How it works
Passengers have certain parameters.
For instance, social confidence level makes them decide if they want to sit next to a person or not.

## Dependencies
Netlogo 6.0.1
I created new shapes but they all should be in the file itself.
